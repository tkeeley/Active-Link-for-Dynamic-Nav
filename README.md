# Active Nav Link For Dynamic Navigation

Using Javascript to add an active class to the nav li link of the current page.

## Description

Style your active class in your css and the Javascript will take the current page url using document.URL and set that li link to .active

##

I made this for use in a site where the header.php file had all the navigation and was unable to use phpo if statement to add the active class, so I went for the Javascript solution. (\*I'm not much of a php guy so Javascript was the easiest route for me anyway)
